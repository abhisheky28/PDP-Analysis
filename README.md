When you have a list of 100 important search queries, and you want to know how many search
results Google shows for each one. Manually searching for each query and copying the result count
is incredibly time-consuming and tedious. If you want to track this data over time to see trends, you'd
have to repeat this process every week or month.
This tool solves that problem.
It is a smart system that runs on your computer. It automatically reads a list of search queries from a
Google Sheet, performs a Google search for each one, and records the total number of results back
into the same sheet. It creates a new column with the current date for each run, allowing you to build
a historical record of search result volumes effortlessly.
